# Geometree
An application written during COVID-19 quaritine to help me tutor students with geometry.
UI is by not, and probably never will be, finished. The figure to string idea works well and makes quickly sharing
and displaying figures easy. This project served it's purpose for me tutoring and I also learned plenty while making it.
